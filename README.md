# Neo NVIM

RIP in peace to my old config.

## Features that I often forget

Press `s` in normal mode, and start typing a pattern. It will highlight that pattern; press enter to jump to it.

In visual mode, press `m` and it will set anchors at all visible block boundaries. Select one, and it will visually select that block.

## Tutorial

`nvim`

`<leader>sk` will show you all keymaps.
